    "|\"For now, let's focus on getting the agent into a real-world product. One of Serena's colleagues created the UI for the Kora app and passed along the project files. Therefore, the front end is complete, but what's missing is the brain behind it, the agent logic, the call to the MCP server, and the model responses.\"<br><br>**Demo Flow - Code Export:**<br><br>1. **Show Code Export Feature**<br>   - \"Within the AI toolkit, Serena can export the agent code via her preferred SDK\"<br>   - Scroll to bottom of Agent Builder<br>   - Click \"View Code\"<br><br>2. **Three SDK Options Shown:**<br>   - Azure AI Inference SDK<br>   - Semantic Kernel SDK<br>   - Microsoft Agent Framework ✓ (Serena's choice)<br><br>3. **Select Framework**<br>   - \"Serena chose to go with the Microsoft agent framework in which Python was her chosen language\"<br>   - Shows complete agent code file<br><br>4. **Review Generated Code**<br>   - Includes system prompt<br>   - Model configuration<br>   - MCP tool connections<br>   - Everything configured in Agent Builder is now code<br><br>5. **Export to Project**<br>   - Can copy code directly<br>   - Or export as file to integrate into existing app<br><br>**Key Point:** \"All the work done in the visual Agent Builder translates directly into production-ready code.\"|\n",
