#### Development Environment

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or higher)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest&pivots=winget) - Used for Azure authentication and resource management
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [AI Toolkit](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit) extension
  - [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension

### Setup the Demo

**Open the repository in the dev container**

1. Open **Docker Desktop**.
1. Fork and clone this repository in Visual Studio Code.
1. When prompted by Visual Studio Code, select to "Reopen in Container". Alternatively, open the **Command Palette** (i.e. CTRL/CMD+Shift+P) and enter **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
1. Wait for the setup to complete. The dev container will build automatically with all dependencies pre-installed. This includes PostgresSQL with pgvector extension, a Python environment, and all required packages.

**Confirm extensions are installed**

Confirm that the dev container has installed the following extensions:
- [Azure Resources](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

1. Confirm that the green **Connected** label displays in the top-right of the UI.

**Create 4 iterations of the Cora agent within the AI Toolkit**

Although you can create the agent live during the demo, it's recommend to already have saved verisons of the Cora agent prepared to mitigate latency or errors with setup.

**V1 Agent - Basic**

1. In the AI Toolkit, navigate to the **Agent Builder**.
1. Create a new agent named **Cora**.
1. For the **Model** field, select **gpt-4.1-mini (Remote via Microsoft Foundry)**.
1. For the **Instructions** field, enter the following:

  ```
  You are Cora, an intelligent and friendly AI assistant for Zava, a home improvement brand. You help customers with their DIY projects by understanding their needs and recommending the most suitable products from Zava’s catalog.​
  
  Your role is to:​
  
  - Engage with the customer in natural conversation to understand their DIY goals.​
  - Ask thoughtful questions to gather relevant project details.
  - Be brief in your responses.​
  - Provide the best solution for the customer's problem and only recommend a relevant product within Zava's product catalog.​
  - Search Zava’s product database to identify 1 product that best match the customer’s needs.​
  - Clearly explain what each recommended Zava product is, why it’s a good fit, and how it helps with their project.​
  ​
  Your personality is:​
  
  - Warm and welcoming, like a helpful store associate​
  - Professional and knowledgeable, like a seasoned DIY expert​
  - Curious and conversational—never assume, always clarify​
  - Transparent and honest—if something isn’t available, offer support anyway​
  
  If no matching products are found in Zava’s catalog, say:​
  “Thanks for sharing those details! I’ve searched our catalog, but it looks like we don’t currently have a product that fits your exact needs. If you'd like, I can suggest some alternatives or help you adjust your project requirements to see if something similar might work.”​
  ```
1. Scroll to the bottom of the Agent Builder and select **Save Version**. Name the version **v1-basic-agent**.

**V2 Agent - Tools**

1. From the **v1-basic-agent**, clear the chat window.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the Agent Builder and select **Save Version**. Name the version **v2-tools-agent**. 

**V3 Agent - Manual Evaluation**

1. From the **v2-tools-agent** agent, switch to the **Evaluation** tab.
1. Select **+ Add an Empty Row** 4 times.
1. Enter the following for the **User Query** values for each row of data:
    - What type of organic compost does Zava have?
    - Does Zava have a paint bucket? If so, how much is it?
    - What color glitter does Zava sell?
    - How much tape measure is currently in stock?
1. Select all rows and click **Run Response** (i.e. the play button icon).
1. Confirm that the agent has provided a response for each row.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the Agent Builder and select **Save Version**. Name the version **v3-manual-evaluation**.

**V4 Agent - Automated Evaluation**

>[!Note]
> Running automated evaluations can take a significant amount of time. It is recommended to run this evaluation in advanced.

>[!Note]
> For your initial run of AI-assisted evaluations, the AI Toolkit extension will download and install the required dependencies. If the Cora agent web app is actively running, temporarily stop the agent as the port it's using will interfere with the evaluation dependency download. After your initial successful run of AI-assisted evaluations, you can subsequently have both the Cora app running as well as execute AI-assisted evaluations given that the required dependencies will have already been downloaded and installed in the container.

1. From the **v3-manual-evaluation** agent, create a new evaluation via the **Add Evaluation** button.
1. Select the following evaluators: `relevance`, `coherence`.
1. Select the **gpt-4.1-mini**  model.
1. Select **Run Evaluation** > **Run Evaluation Only**.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the Agent Builder and select **Save Version**. Name the version **v4-automated-evaluation**.
