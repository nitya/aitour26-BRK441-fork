## Transcript

The transcript provided below is from the recorded demo video for [Create Agents with Agent Builder](https://aka.ms/AAxq4rm). You can also view this transcript inside the speaker notes of the breakout slide deck.

**00:00:01:19 - 00:00:22:18**

Here within the AI toolkit, I will open up the Agent Builder. With this open, I can now create the Cora agent. Starting off with giving the agent a name. We'll name the agent Cora as mentioned. And then we want to make sure that we've chosen the proper model. And in our case, we want to use GPT 4.1 mini from Microsoft Foundry.

**00:00:22:20 - 00:00:42:14**

Now that the model has been loaded, we can pass in a system prompt for the agent. If you are challenged with creating system prompts, then no problem, because we have a feature in the AI toolkit where we can generate a system prompt for you. What you'll need to do is pass in a description of the task that your agent will be completing.

**00:00:42:19 - 00:00:57:06**

And then we're leveraging AI to generate the system prompt for you. I happen to actually already have the system prompt that Serena used when creating the Cora agent. So I'll put that in here.

**00:00:57:08 - 00:01:28:14**

Now it is quite lengthy, so I won't read it in its entirety, but to get a gist of what's happening here, the agent is intelligent, friendly, and it's helping customers from the Zava brand, a home improvement brand. And then we go on to define the agents role. We also include information about the personality as well. In the event I would like some assistance with improving the system prompt, we have a feature available in here that can help you out as well.

**00:01:28:16 - 00:01:48:11**

Notice where we once had the generate button. It now says improve. If you pass in a system prompt and you would like improvement, you can choose the improve button. And then you can describe what it is you want to change. Once you describe what it is you want to change. We will also use AI again to help make the improvements.

**00:01:48:12 - 00:01:59:07**

And then from there you can decide which you want to keep, what you want to get rid of, and so on and so forth. So I'll close that up, because we're going to use the one that Serena created.

**00:01:59:09 - 00:02:22:00**

So now let's give this agent a try. As it is going to submit a prompt that customers like Bruno may submit. We're going to use his living room image and it says, here's a photo of my living room. I'm not sure whether I should go with eggshell or semi-gloss. Can you tell which would work better based on the lighting and layout?

**00:02:22:02 - 00:02:50:03**

We're going to go ahead and submit that here to the Cora agent, and let's just see how the Cora agent responds. So Cora is able to process what's happening in the image that we've passed in. Core insists that it has a soft, natural light coming through a window in its cozy, understated decor style. And so given the ample light and the elegant but relaxed vibe, eggshell is what Cora is recommending.

**00:02:50:05 - 00:02:52:14**

And so from here.

**00:02:52:16 - 00:03:16:10**

Cora is asking follow up questions to the customer. So that way it can better determine whether the eggshell paint is going to be most appropriate. But although we have this recommendation from Cora at this step, what is missing is the fact that Cora does not yet have access to Zava's product catalog.

**00:03:16:12 - 00:03:22:02**

And this is where MCP or Model Context Protocol comes into play.
