# Demo Instructions: Create an Agent

**Instructions**: Navigate to the **Agent Builder** and select the v1 agent. Select the **Microsoft Foundry GPT-4o** model as the model.

**Script**: Here in the Agent Builder, I created a new agent named Cora.​
I’ll select GPT-4o from Microsoft Foundry as the chosen model and now I’m ready to customize the agent.​

​**Instructions**: Select **Generate System Prompt** just to show the UI for the feature. Exit the feature. In the **System Prompt** field, add **Cora's System Prompt** from below.

**Script**: Serena shared with me the system message that she created for Cora, so we’ll leverage what she’s already created. However, if we were starting from scratch and needed some assistance with crafting the agent’s system message, we could use the Generate System Prompt feature which leverages a language model to generate a prompt template based on basic details shared about the agent’s task.​

​**Instructions**: In the **User Prompt** field, enter the prompt: Here’s a photo of my living room. I’m not sure whether I should go with eggshell or semi-gloss. Can you tell which would work better based on the lighting and layout?​ Next, upload the living room photo located in img/demo-living-room.png. Run the prompt.

**Script**: Let’s chat with Cora to see how she responds to Bruno’s inquiry about painting product recommendations for his living room.​

---

​**Instructions**: Review the model response.

**Script**: As we see, Cora’s friendly, helpful, and handles the entire customer conversation.​ But there’s one thing Cora doesn’t do directly: product lookups.​ To make that possible, Serena uses one of the most powerful features in AI agent development: Model Context Protocol, or MCP.​ Let me show you how it works.​
